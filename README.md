## Description
This project aims to predict images using different optimizers in neural networks, such as SGD, Adam, and RMSprop.
The objective is to predict imagines based on their label, and analyze the impact of these optimizers on model performance, including convergence speed and accuracy.

## Importing Necessary Libraries
The following libraries are required for this project:
- `numpy` as `np`
- `tensorflow` as `tf`
- `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`

Make sure these libraries are installed and imported correctly for the project to run smoothly.


## Environment
You need to be in a virtual environment to run this project.

To do this

- Go to the ‘AI_Project’ project folder
- Do: python -m venv ‘virtual_environment_name’ (here env for example)
- Then activate the virtual environment: env/Scripts/activate
- Then: pip install -r requirements.txt (this will install everything in the requirements.txt file)

## Run the project:
- To run the project: python main.py
